<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>ovscout2 is a free, open-source R/Shiny app for scouting volleyball
matches. It provides industry-standard dvw files that can be used with
the <a href="https://openvolley.org" class="external-link">openvolley</a> suite of R packages,
or with any other volleyball analytics software that takes dvw files as
inputs.</p>
<p>The app requires that you have a video of the match <em>from a fixed
view point</em> (i.e. the camera does not move for the duration of the
match). Such videos are usually taken from the “scout viewpoint” —
behind one end of the court, at a reasonable height so that the entire
court is clearly visible and players on court do not tend to occlude
each other.</p>
<p>The app is writen in R, but you do not necessarily need to be an R
user to be able to use it. We provide script files to launch the app
from the command line (although you will need to install R itself on
some platforms, see below). If you are not an R user, see the
“Standalone” section below for installation and startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installation"></a>
</h2>
<p>You need to be online for installation. The app initially needs to
download and install some additional R packages (quite a few, in fact).
Once the app has been installed and run once, it can be used offline
thereafter if necessary.</p>
<p>Also see the “Other system utilities” section, below.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="standalone">Standalone<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#standalone"></a>

<p>The standalone installer allows you to run the app without having to
do anything in R.</p>

<p>Two other system utilities are recommended but not required. Note
that the standalone Windows bundle already includes these utilities — no
further action is needed in that case.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>ffmpeg is used to extract frames from videos, and other
video-related functions. If <code>ffmpeg</code> is not available, an
internal fallback method is used for some functionality, but may be
considerably slower. Install <code>ffmpeg</code> via your package
manager, or (from within R, on Linux and Windows only) using
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/ovideo/man/ov_install_ffmpeg.html" class="external-link">ovideo::ov_install_ffmpeg()</a></code></p></li>
<li><p>lighttpd <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/" class="external-link uri">https://www.lighttpd.net/</a> is a lightweight web server
that is used to play the match video. Install (from within R, on Windows
only) using <code><a href="../reference/ov_install_lighttpd.html">ovscout2::ov_install_lighttpd()</a></code> or manually
from <a href="http://lighttpd.dtech.hu/" class="external-link uri">http://lighttpd.dtech.hu/</a> (for Windows) or via your
package manager for other operating systems (see <a href="https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/GetLighttpd" class="external-link uri">https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/GetLighttpd</a>).
If lighttpd is not installed, the app falls back to a built-in web
server but this is a little slower and less responsive than
lighttpd.</p></li>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="startup-and-usage">Startup and usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#startup-and-usage"></a>
</h2>
<p>Some of startup options are the same regardless of whether you are
using the standalone version or starting the app from within R:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the “season directory” is a folder containing dvw files from
other matches. If you are scouting a new match and you provide a season
directory, you can choose teams from other matches for the new match.
This saves having to re-enter team and player details. The season
directory will also be used as the starting point when selecting a video
file</p></li>
<li><p>the video file is required</p></li>
<li><p>you can also optionally provide a .dvw or .ovs file (i.e. a
partially-scouted file that you wish to continue scouting). If you do
not provide a dvw file, the app creates a new, empty match
file.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="startup-standalone">Startup — standalone<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#startup-standalone"></a>
</h3>
<p>Run the <code>ov_scouter.bat</code> (Windows) or
<code>ov_scouter</code> (Linux/Mac) script. It will prompt you for a
season directory, dvw file, and video file. The season directory and dvw
file are optional (a new match file will be created if no dvw is
provided) but the video is required.</p>
<p>Options controlling the app behaviour and scouting preferences can be
changed via the “Preferences” button in the app.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="startup-from-r">Startup — from R<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#startup-from-r"></a>
</h3>
<p>In each session you first need to load the <code>ovscout2</code>
package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/openvolley/ovscout2" class="external-link">ovscout2</a></span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then start the app. You can start it with no arguments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and it will prompt you (as for the standalone version) for a season
directory, dvw file, and video file. The season directory and dvw file
are optional (a new match file will be created if no dvw is provided)
but the video is required.</p>
<p>You can optionally provide those arguments explicitly. To start a new
match for a certain video file, using teams from already-scouted matches
in your season directory, you could do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span>video_file <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"/path/to/video.mp4"</span>, season_dir <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"/path/to/season_dir"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have already partially-scouted a match and saved that file,
you can re-start scouting:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"/path/to/saved_file.ovs"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(In this case you do not need to provide the video file path, because
that is saved within the .ovs file.)</p>
<p>There are several other options that can be provided to the
<code><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter()</a></code> function, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>auto_save_dir</code> is a directory into which the scouted
file will be saved (in .dvw format) after each rally. You can use this
to e.g. provide live updates to the coaching bench</li>
<li>
<code>scoreboard</code> - show the scoreboard in the top right-hand
corner of the video screen (true by default)</li>
<li>
<code>ball_path</code> - show the ball path on the court diagram
(false by default, because it slows the app down a little)</li>
<li>
<code>review_pane</code> - show the video review pane on each data
entry popup (true by default)</li>
<li>
<code>playlist_display_option</code> - what to show in the plays
table? Either “dv_codes” (scouted codes) or “commentary” (a
plain-language interpretation of the touches)</li>
<li>
<code>shortcuts</code> - a named list that defines the keyboard
shortcuts used in the app</li>
<li>
<code>scouting_options</code>, <code>default_scouting_table</code>,
<code>compound_table</code> - advanced options controlling details of
the scouting process</li>
</ul>
<p>Options controlling the app behaviour and scouting preferences can be
changed via the “Preferences” button in the app.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="starting-a-new-match">Starting a new match<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#starting-a-new-match"></a>
</h2>
<p>To scout a new match, start the app with the corresponding video
file, then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Define the court reference via the “Court reference” button. This
requires you to click on the four corners of the court in the video
image, so that the app can map clicks in the video to real-world court
coordinates</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the match details via the “Edit match data” button (match
date, venue, scout name, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Define the teams playing in the match. If you have provided a
season directory (with existing .dvw or .ovs files in it) you can choose
from the teams in those files. Otherwise you can enter new
teams</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the team lineups for set 1, including the libero(s) for
each team. If two liberos are entered, then the app will assume that the
first libero is on court during serve reception (i.e. the “passing”
libero) and the second libero is on court while serving (the “defending”
libero). If the team has two liberos but only one takes to the court per
set, then just enter the libero who is actually going to play in that
set</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="scouting">Scouting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scouting"></a>
</h2>
<p>The scouting process is a guided one. Each contact is marked by
clicking on the video at the time and point of contact, with the
<strong>point of contact being the point on the floor directly below the
ball as it is being played</strong>. This will often be between the
player’s feet as they dig or set the ball, or below them if they are
jumping to spike.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="start-by">Start by:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#start-by"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>checking that the orientation of the court diagram (top right)
matches the video. Swap it using the ⇵ button if required</p></li>
<li><p>check that the correct team is serving (indicated by the white
circle in the court diagram). Swap with the “Change serving team” button
if required</p></li>
<li><p>unpause the video. The number of the serving player and their
serve type (float/jump/etc) will be shown below the video panel. You can
change the serve type before the serve, if you can see that it is
wrong</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="first-contact-serve">First contact (serve)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-contact-serve"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>click the serve (the point on the court below the ball) as it
happens. The video will continue playing</p></li>
<li><p>click the reception location (if the ball is touched by a
receiver) OR the point where the ball lands/hits the net (if it is an
untouched ace or an error). The video will automatically pause and a
dialog will pop up allowing you to select the receiving player and serve
outcome (serve error, ace, or reception in play). You can also adjust
the serve type if it was incorrect. In some cases it isn’t clear at this
point if the serve was an ace or a “reception in play” (e.g. a shanked
pass that players are chasing down, but we haven’t yet seen if they are
successful). In this case click “Reception in play”. It can be adjusted
to an “Ace” at the next step, if necessary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you did not click the reception location correctly, or for some
other reason want to go back and try again, click “Cancel and rewind”.
Otherwise click “Continue” and the video will resume playing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="second-contact-set">Second contact (set)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#second-contact-set"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>click the location of the set (or second-contact action if it was
something else, such as a setter tip. Remember that this is the point on
the ground directly below the ball, not the ball itself). The video will
pause and a data entry dialog will pop up</p></li>
<li><p>choose the correct second-contact action (by default this is a
“Set” but it can also be a set error, setter tip, second-ball attack, or
freeball over. If the reception turned out to be an error here (serve
ace, with no second contact to scout) you can also select that
here</p></li>
<li><p>check the pass quality. It will have been automatically given a
grade, but in some situations you might need to override the automatic
assessment</p></li>
<li><p>if the pass was an overpass, you can assign the appropriate
opposition action (dig, dig error, or overpass attack) and
player</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second contact is by default a set, by the assigned setter on
court. Once you are comfortable with the scouting process, and you see a
second contact set by the setter, you can hold down shift while clicking
the second contact. This causes the app to enter a set action (by the
setter) with the automatically-assigned pass quality, without stopping
the video or showing the data entry dialog, which makes this part of the
scouting faster.</p>
<p>Similarly to a reception error, in some cases it isn’t immediately
clear if the set is an error or not (e.g. an unhittable set, or a
delayed double-contact call by the referee). Scout this as a set (by the
appropriate player) and it can be converted to a set error in the next
step if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="third-contact-attack">Third contact (attack)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#third-contact-attack"></a>
</h3>
<p>The third contact is most commonly an attack (but can also be a
freeball over or set error, or a play by the opposition on an
overpass/overset.</p>
<ul>
<li>click the contact location (remember that this is the point on the
ground directly below the ball, not the ball itself). The video will
pause and a data entry dialog will pop up</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is an attack:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>enter the attacking player and either the attack combination code
(if you are scouting with combo codes) or tempo</p></li>
<li><p>optionally (but recommended) enter the number of blockers on the
attack</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise enter the appropriate action and player.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="attack-end-point">Attack end point<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attack-end-point"></a>
</h3>
<p>After an attack or freeball over, click the end point (point where
the ball lands, or the point on the court directly below the ball when
it is played).</p>
<p>Enter the appropriate details. An attack kill, dig or dig error can
also involve a block touch — this can be recorded (see “With block touch
by player …”).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="transition-play">Transition play<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transition-play"></a>
</h3>
<p>Scouting now continues until the point ends, with attacks, digs, and
other contacts being recorded. By default, <em>sets in transition are
not scouted</em> (except for set errors, since a set error will end the
rally). After an attack, we record the dig location and then straight to
the counter-attack location, with no intervening set being scouted. You
can choose to include transition sets if you are running the app from R
(see <code><a href="../reference/ov_scouting_options.html">help("ov_scouting_options")</a></code>) but there is not a huge
practical advantage in doing so (it does not enable much more in terms
of analytics, but takes extra time to scout, so we have disabled these
by default).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="end-of-the-point">End of the point<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#end-of-the-point"></a>
</h3>
<p>The point can be ended by entering a terminal action (kill or error),
or if the point ends in a way that doesn’t fit nicely with the available
options, you can pause the video (press “q” or the pause button) and
choose “Won current rally” for the appropriate team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="end-of-set">End of set<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#end-of-set"></a>
</h3>
<p>When the set concludes, it will prompt you to confirm whether it is
the end of the set. Confirm the end of the set and then enter the
lineups for the next set ready to start scouting that one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timeouts-and-substitutions">Timeouts and substitutions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeouts-and-substitutions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Pausing the video (press “q” or the pause button) will bring up a
dialog that allows you to enter a timeout or substitution, or change the
setter on court for a given team (e.g. if the team is playing a
two-setter system, you will need to change the setter on court each time
the setters swap).</p>

<p>The .ovs file format is used internally by the app to store a match
as it is being scouted. It is similar to a .dvw file, but contains more
information than a .dvw file and in a different format. If you save a
partially-scouted match and come back to it later to continue scouting,
use the .ovs file format. (You can continue scouting from a
partially-scouted file in .dvw format, but the “undo” functionality is
limited).</p>
<p>If you have finished scouting a match and wish to use that match file
in other analysis software (including the openvolley R packages), export
it to dvw format and use that.</p>
