<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>ovscout2 is a free, open-source R/Shiny app for scouting volleyball
matches. It provides industry-standard dvw files that can be used with
the <a href="https://openvolley.org" class="external-link">openvolley</a> suite of R packages,
or with any other volleyball analytics software that takes dvw files as
inputs.</p>
<p>The app offers two modes of scouting: using a guided point-and-click
interface, or by typing.</p>
<p>Click-scouting is very easy to learn but still delivers high-quality
scout files. It requires that you have a video of the match <em>from a
fixed view point</em> (i.e. the camera does not move for the duration of
the match, or at the very least it only moves occasionally). Such videos
are usually taken from the “scout viewpoint” — behind one end of the
court, at a reasonable height so that the entire court is clearly
visible and players on court do not tend to occlude each other.</p>
<p>The app is writen in R, but you do not need to be an R user to be
able to use it. We provide script files to launch the app from the
command line — see the <a href="#standalone">Standalone</a> section
below for installation and startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installation"></a>
</h2>
<p>The app can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac systems. It is possible
to run the app on a laptop or desktop and connect to that with a tablet
or similar touch device to do the actual scouting. See <a href="#device-considerations">Device considerations</a> below.</p>
<p>You need to be online for installation. The app initially needs to
download and install some additional R packages (quite a few, in fact).
Once the app has been installed and run once, it can be used offline
thereafter.</p>
<p>Also see the “Other system utilities” section, below.</p>
<div class="section level3">

<p>Two other system utilities are recommended but not required. Note
that the standalone Windows bundle already includes these utilities — no
further action is needed in that case.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/" class="external-link">pandoc</a> is required

<li><p><a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/" class="external-link">lighttpd</a> is a lightweight
web server that is used to play the match video (when using a local

<h2 id="startup">Startup<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#startup"></a>
</h2>
<p>Some of startup options are the same regardless of whether you are
using the standalone version or starting the app from within R:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the “season directory” is a folder containing dvw files from
other matches. If you are scouting a new match and you provide a season
directory, you can choose teams from other matches for the new match.
This saves having to re-enter team and player details. The season
directory will also be used as the starting point when selecting a video
file</p></li>
<li><p>the video file is required for click-scouting, and optional for
type-scouting</p></li>
<li><p>you can also optionally provide a .dvw or .ovs file (i.e. a
partially-scouted file that you wish to continue scouting). If you do
not provide a dvw file, the app creates a new, empty match
file.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="startup-standalone">Startup — standalone<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#startup-standalone"></a>
</h3>
<p>Run the <code>ov_scouter.bat</code> (Windows) or
<code>ov_scouter</code> (Linux/Mac) script. It will prompt you for a
season directory, dvw file, and video file. The season directory and dvw
file are optional (a new match file will be created if no dvw is
provided) but the video is required for click-scouting.</p>
<p>Options controlling the app behaviour and scouting preferences can be
changed via the “Preferences” button in the app. You can switch from
click-mode scouting to type-mode or vice-versa from within the app — see
<a href="#switching-scout-modes">Switching scout modes</a> below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="startup-from-r">Startup — from R<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#startup-from-r"></a>

<p>In each session you first need to load the ovscout2 package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/openvolley/ovscout2" class="external-link">ovscout2</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then start the app. You can start it with no arguments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and it will prompt you (as for the standalone version) for a season
directory, dvw file, and video file. The season directory and dvw file
are optional (a new match file will be created if no dvw is provided)
but the video is required.</p>
<p>You can optionally provide those arguments explicitly. To start a new
match for a certain video file, using teams from already-scouted matches
in your season directory, you could do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span>video_file <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"/path/to/video.mp4"</span>, season_dir <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"/path/to/season_dir"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have already partially-scouted a match and saved that file,
you can re-start scouting:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"/path/to/saved_file.ovs"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>(In this case you do not need to provide the video file path, because
that is saved within the .ovs file.)</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="starting-a-new-match">Starting a new match<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#starting-a-new-match"></a>
</h2>
<p>To scout a new match, start the app, then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you are using video, define the court reference via the “Court
reference” button. This requires you to click on the four corners of the
court in the video image, so that the app can translate click locations
on the video to real-world court coordinates. This is mandatory for
click-scouting and optional for type-scouting (but if you don’t do it,
you can’t click the video in order to add precise locations to ball
touches. You can click the small court diagram instead).</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the match details via the “Edit match data” button (match
date, venue, scout name, etc). You can do this later if you are in a
hurry.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the teams playing in the match. If you have provided a
season directory (with existing .dvw or .ovs files in it) you can choose
from the teams in those files (“Select teams” button). Otherwise you can
enter new teams via the “Edit teams” button.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are in a hurry, use the
“<i class="fas fa-truck-fast" role="presentation" aria-label="truck-fast icon"></i>
Fast start” button in the “Edit teams” dialog. This will automatically
populate players with numbers 1–99 in a team. You can do this, scout the
match, and then return later to (automatically) remove players that
don’t actually exist and assign the correct names to the ones who
do.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the team lineups for set 1, including the libero(s) for
each team. If two liberos are entered, then the app will assume that the
first libero is on court during serve reception (i.e. the “passing”
libero) and the second libero is on court while serving (the “defending”
libero). If the team has two liberos but only one takes to the court per
set, then just enter the libero who is actually going to play in that
set</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And before unpausing the video and starting to scout, check that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the orientation of the court diagram (top right) matches the
video. Swap it using the ⇵ button if required</p></li>
<li><p>check that the correct team is serving (indicated by the white
circle in the court diagram). Swap with the “Change serving team” button
if required</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scouting process is discussed in <a href="#scouting-in-detail">Scouting in detail</a>, below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="preferences-and-keyboard-shortcuts">Preferences and keyboard shortcuts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preferences-and-keyboard-shortcuts"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are a number of options available that alter the behaviour or
appearance of the app. These can be set (if you are starting the app
from within R) via parameters to the <code><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter()</a></code> function.
Most can also be set via the “Preferences” button in the app (others
will be added in due course):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>scout_mode</code> sets your preferred scouting mode
(clicking or typing)</p></li>
<li><p><code>auto_save_dir</code> is a directory into which the scouted
file will be saved (in .dvw format) after each rally. You can use this
to e.g. provide live file updates to be used by the coaching
bench</p></li>
<li><p><code>scoreboard</code> - show the scoreboard in the top
right-hand corner of the video screen (true by default)</p></li>
<li><p><code>ball_path</code> - show the ball path on the court diagram
(false by default, because it slows the app down a little)</p></li>
<li><p><code>review_pane</code> - show the video review pane on each
data entry popup (true by default)</p></li>
<li><p><code>playlist_display_option</code> - what to show in the plays
table? Either “dv_codes” (scouted codes) or “commentary” (a
plain-language interpretation of the touches)</p></li>
<li><p><code>click_shortcuts</code> - a named list that defines the
keyboard shortcuts used in the app when in click-scouting mode</p></li>
<li><p><code>type_shortcuts</code> - a named list that defines the
keyboard shortcuts used in the app when in type-scouting mode</p></li>
<li><p><code>playstable_shortcuts</code> - a named list that defines the
keyboard shortcuts used in the playstable, in both click-scouting and
type-scouting mode</p></li>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="click-scouting-conventions">Click-scouting conventions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#click-scouting-conventions"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few ways in which you can tailor the click-scouting to
your requirements. These can set via the
<code><a href="../reference/ov_scouting_options.html">ov_scouting_options()</a></code> function or the “Click-scouting
conventions” pane in the preferences. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>end_convention</code> determines whether you are treating
the end coordinate of an attack or serve as the <strong>actual</strong>
end location (i.e. where the ball contacted the floor or out of bounds
area), or the <strong>intended</strong> end location. The actual might
differ from the intended if there is a block touch or the ball hit the
net. If “actual”, and a block touch is recorded, then the end location
of the attack will not be used for the dig location (the dig location
will be missing).</p></li>
<li><p><code>nblockers</code> and <code>default_nblockers</code>. If
<code>nblockers</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the data entry will
include a section to enter the number of blockers on each attack. This
is recommended and set to <code>TRUE</code> by default. The
<code>default_nblockers</code> value can be used to set the number of
blockers that will be pre-selected on each attack. Having a default
value might speed up the data entry process very slightly but it is not
recommended because it’s easy to forget to update it on each attack and
then your data will include default-valued entries that you can’t easily
distinguish from genuine ones that you actually entered.</p></li>
<li><p><code>transition_sets</code>. If <code>FALSE</code>, then sets in
transition are not scouted. After entering an attack end location (and
play continues) the next click will be for the counterattack start
location, with no set scouted in between.</p></li>
<li><p><code>attacks_by</code> allows attacks to be recorded by
combination code (“X5”, “V5”, etc) or just by tempo (high, medium,
quick)</p></li>
<li><p><code>set_quality</code>. If <code>FALSE</code> (which is the
default), set actions are not graded, although set errors and over-sets
(a set that goes over the net) are marked as such. If
<code>set_quality</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, the data entry will
include a section where each set can be graded as “excellent”, “good”,
“OK”, or “poor”.</p></li>
<li>
<p><code>setter_calls</code>. The “setter call” is where the setter
instructs their middle to run. For example, a setter call of “K2” means
that the middle hitter ran behind the setter (as if to hit a quick ball
behind). The setter call is entered even if the setter actually set
someone else. You can set this to “none” (no setter calls), “reception”
(setter calls on reception-phase attacks only), or “both” (setter calls
will be recorded on both reception-phase and transition-phase attacks).
Setter calls are not recorded on poor reception/dig or overpasses.</p>
<p>Note that if you are not scouting transition sets, you can’t record
setter calls in transition because the setter call code is attached to
the setting action. If <code>transition_sets</code> is
<code>FALSE</code> and <code>setter_calls</code> is “both”, it will be
treated as “reception”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="type-scouting-conventions">Type-scouting conventions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#type-scouting-conventions"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many fewer convention settings for type-scouting, because
those conventions are largely controllled directly by the scout and what
they are entering when they type. The only setting here is whether the
scout is using zones or cones to record attack directions. See the <a href="#switching-between-zones-and-cones">Switching between zones and
cones</a> section below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#shortcuts"></a>
</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts can be viewed by clicking the
“<i class="far fa-keyboard" role="presentation" aria-label="keyboard icon"></i>
Keyboard” button.</p>
<p>Shortcuts can be changed from the shortcuts pane (click the shortcut
in question and type the new shortcut key to use). Changes to shortcuts
made within the app cannot currently be saved, but users starting from R
can specify shortcuts via the <code>click_shortcuts</code>,
<code>type_shortcuts</code>, and <code>playstable_shortcuts</code>
parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="key-remapping">Key remapping<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-remapping"></a>
</h3>
<p>In type-scouting mode it is possible to remap keys (so that when you
press a particular key, it is treated as if it were a different key).
This remapping is commmonly done by scouts so that their keyboard input
can be faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>The only key remapped by default is the “;” key, which is remapped to
“a”. Key remappings can only be changed when starting from R (see the
<code>key_remapping</code> parameter). It is not currently possible to
change the key remappings when using the standalone startup.</p>

<p>The click-scouting process is a guided one. Each contact is marked by
clicking on the video at the time and point of contact, with the
<strong>point of contact being the point on the floor directly below the
ball as it is being played</strong>. This will often be between the
player’s feet as they dig or set the ball, or below them if they are
jumping to spike.</p>
<ul>
<li>unpause the video. The number of the serving player and their serve
type (float/jump/etc) will be shown below the video panel. You can
change the serve type before the serve, if you can see that it is
wrong</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="first-contact-serve">First contact (serve)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-contact-serve"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>click the serve (the point on the court below the ball) as it
happens. The video will continue playing</p></li>
<li><p>click the reception location (if the ball is touched by a
receiver) OR the point where the ball lands/hits the net (if it is an
untouched ace or an error). The video will automatically pause and a
dialog will pop up allowing you to select the receiving player and serve
outcome (serve error, ace, or reception in play). You can also adjust
the serve type if it was incorrect. In some cases it isn’t clear at this
point if the serve was an ace or a “reception in play” (e.g. a shanked
pass that players are chasing down, but we haven’t yet seen if they are
successful). In this case click “Reception in play”. It can be adjusted
to an “Ace” at the next step, if necessary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you did not click the reception location correctly, or for some
other reason want to go back and try again, click “Cancel and rewind”.
Otherwise click “Continue” and the video will resume playing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="second-contact-set">Second contact (set)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#second-contact-set"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>click the location of the set (or second-contact action if it was
something else, such as a setter tip. Remember that this is the point on
the ground directly below the ball, not the ball itself). The video will
pause and a data entry dialog will pop up</p></li>
<li><p>choose the correct second-contact action (by default this is a
“Set” but it can also be a set error, setter tip, second-ball attack, or
freeball over. If the reception turned out to be an error here (serve
ace, with no second contact to scout) you can also select that
here</p></li>
<li><p>if you are including setter calls, select the appropriate one
here. The setter call buttons will be hidden on poor passes and
overpasses</p></li>
<li><p>check the pass quality. It will have been automatically given a
grade, but in some situations you might need to override the automatic
assessment</p></li>
<li><p>if the pass was an overpass, you can assign the appropriate
opposition action (dig, dig error, or overpass attack) and
player</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second contact is by default a set, by the assigned setter on
court. Once you are comfortable with the scouting process, and if you
are not including setter calls, it is possible to streamline the
scouting process slightly: when you see a second contact set by the
setter, you can hold down the shift key while clicking the second
contact. This causes the app to enter a set action (by the setter) with
the automatically-assigned pass quality, without stopping the video or
showing the data entry dialog, which makes this part of the scouting
faster.</p>
<p>Similarly to a reception error, in some cases it isn’t immediately
clear if the set is an error or not (e.g. an unhittable set, or a
delayed double-contact call by the referee). Scout this as a set (by the
appropriate player) and it can be converted to a set error in the next
step if necessary.</p>
<p>If you are including set quality, this is chosen on the next data
entry dialog (so that you have time to see the set and evaluate it).</p>

<p>The third contact is most commonly an attack (but can also be a
freeball over or set error, or a play by the opposition on an
overpass/overset.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>click the contact location (remember that this is the point on
the ground directly below the ball, not the ball itself). The video will
pause and a data entry dialog will pop up</p></li>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="attack-end-point">Attack end point<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attack-end-point"></a>
</h4>
<p>After an attack or freeball over, click the end point. If you are
scouting with “actual” end convention (see <a href="#preferences-and-keyboard-shortcuts">Preferences and keyboard
shortcuts</a>) then this is the point where the ball lands, or the point
on the court directly below the ball when it is played. If end
convention is “intended”, this is the point where the attacker intended
to hit the ball.</p>
<p>If the ball deflects off the block or the net, and you want the ball
path to show this exactly, you can do this by entering the attack as
normal, and then going back afterwards (at the end of the rally,
perhaps) and editing the coordinates. Click the
<i class="fas fa-location-dot" role="presentation" aria-label="location-dot icon"></i>
icon underneath the court rotation diagram and you will be prompted to
enter new coordinates for the attack, including a middle coordinate that
can be used to show the block deflection.</p>
<p>Enter the appropriate details. An attack kill, dig or dig error can
also involve a block touch — this can be recorded (see “With block touch
by player …”).</p>
<p>If the attack was dug (i.e. play continues) and you do not care about
scouting digs, you can shift-click the attack end point and the app will
record the end point of the attack without showing a popup dialog. This
is faster, but note that no dig will be scouted, and no block touch can
be entered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="transition-play">Transition play<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transition-play"></a>
</h4>
<p>Scouting now continues until the point ends, with attacks, digs, and
other contacts being recorded. By default, <em>sets in transition are
not scouted</em> (except for set errors, since a set error will end the
rally). After an attack, we record the dig location and then straight to
the counter-attack location, with no intervening set being scouted. You
can choose to include transition sets if you wish (see <a href="#preferences-and-keyboard-shortcuts">Preferences and keyboard
shortcuts</a> to change this behaviour) but there is not a huge
practical advantage in doing so. It does not enable much more in terms
of analytics, but takes extra time to scout, so transition sets are
disabled by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="end-of-the-point">End of the point<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#end-of-the-point"></a>
</h4>
<p>The point can be ended by entering a terminal action (kill or error),
or if the point ends in a way that doesn’t fit nicely with the available
options, you can pause the video (press the pause shortcut key) and
choose “Won current rally” for the appropriate team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="end-of-the-set">End of the set<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#end-of-the-set"></a>

the end of the set. Confirm the end of the set and then enter the
lineups for the next set ready to start scouting that one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="end-of-the-match">End of the match<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#end-of-the-match"></a>

<p>At the end of the match, you don’t need to do anything extra. Just
end the final set as normal, and ignore the instruction to enter the
lineups for the next set. And now you can generate a match report, if
you wish!</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="timeouts-and-substitutions">Timeouts and substitutions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeouts-and-substitutions"></a>

<p>Pausing the video (press the pause shortcut key) will bring up a
dialog that allows you to enter a timeout or substitution, or change the
setter on court for a given team (e.g. if the team is playing a
two-setter system, you will need to change the setter on court each time
the setters swap).</p>

</h3>
<p>An introduction to type-scouting is beyond the scope of this manual.
You can find some information online or through (paid) courses and
books. If you are not already familiar with type-scouting, it is
strongly recommended that you use the click-scouting mode instead. It is
designed to allow high-quality match information to be recorded but with
a vastly easier learning curve.</p>
<p>For type-scout users, be aware that there are some non-standard
scouting codes that can be used in ovscout2 that might save you a few
keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>starting lineups can be entered with <code>L</code> codes such as
<code>L 4,7s,8,10,1,3,17</code> (you can use spaces instead of commas if
you prefer). The first six numbers give the players starting in
positions 1–6, with “s” being used to designate the setter. The 7th (and
8th) numbers after the <code>L</code> are optional and are the
libero(s). Use <code>aL</code> for the visiting team lineup.</p></li>
<li>
<p>attack combinations can be entered without the player number. For
example, if the home team made an <code>X5</code> attack kill to
position/cone 3 you can enter <code>X53#</code> without the player’s
jersey number (use <code>aX5...</code> for the visiting team). ovscout2
will automatically infer the player number. For an <code>X5</code>
attack this is the front-row outside hitter, except in P1-reception when
the opposite is expected to hit from position 4. Note some limitations
on this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it can’t assign a player number to second-ball attacks
(<code>P2</code> by default) or overpass attacks
(<code>PR</code>);</p></li>
<li><p>it uses the attack start zone and setter position (team rotation)
to infer the player number;</p></li>
<li><p>it assumes that the team is playing with standard player role
patterns and a setter-outside-middle rotation (i.e. the close outside
hitter is in position 2 when the setter is in 1).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the team plays with some other patterns, or if these assumptions
don’t hold for a particular attack, provide the player number in the
scout code as usual.</p>
</li>
<li><p>setter calls in reception need only be <code>Kx</code> — the set
action will be assigned to the on-court setter of the receiving team.
Setter calls in transition, if you wish to include them, will need the
team identifier as well (i.e. <code>*Kx</code> or
<code>aKx</code>),</p></li>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="zones-and-cones-in-detail">Zones and cones in detail<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zones-and-cones-in-detail"></a>
</h3>
<p>Scouted match files allow locations of court to be recorded in
several different ways with differing levels of accuracy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>zones</em> are a 3 x 3 grid of squares on each side of the court
(so one zone is a 3m x 3m square on an indoor court) and numbered
1–9</li>
<li>each zone can be divided into four <em>subzones</em> A–D (each
subzone is a 1.5m x 1.5m square on an indoor court)</li>
<li>coordinates lie on a 100 x 101 grid that covers the entire court
plus a margin around the outside of it, giving locations with a
resolution of about 10cm.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="ovscout2-user-manual_files/figure-html/court_plot-1.png" width="700"></p>
<p>Zones and subzones apply to all skills. Attack end locations have an
extra option of <em>cones</em>, which are numbered 1–7 (1–8 for middle
attacks) and give the direction of the attack. Attack end
locations/directions can be stored as cones <em>or</em> zones but not
both in the same file. It is a common (but not universal) convention
when scouting with cones that the cone gives the <em>intended</em>
direction of attack, not the actual direction (the two might differ if
the ball deflected off the block or the net).</p>
<p>In conventional scouting software, zones and subzones can be entered
through the typed-in scout codes, but coordinates must be entered by
clicking on a court diagram. In ovscout2 in click mode, all locations
are recorded as coordinates (from the clicks that you make on the video
or court diagram) and are converted internally to zones and subzones.
When you export a click-scouted match to dvw, you have the option of
converting attack end locations to cone directions, which will be
generated from the attack end coordinates.</p>
<p>If you are type-scouting, you must choose between zones or cones for
your attack end location/directions. It is not advisable to switch
between them while scouting a match, because the existing zone end data
will not be converted to cones (or vice-versa, if you are going the
other way) and you will end up with inconsistent information in your
match file. It is not possible to losslessly convert from zones to
cones: zones don’t map uniquely to cones (and vice-versa). Coordinates
can be converted to zones or cones, but be aware that your scouting
conventions will matter for interpreting the end result. If you have
click-scouted attacks with the end point being the actual end point of
the attack (i.e. the dig location) then a cone can be assigned but it
will be the actual direction of attack, not necessarily the intended
direction. If you are click-scouting with intended attack end points
then attacks with a block touch won’t have an end point recorded (and no
cone will be assigned to those attacks when exporting to dvw with cones,
nor a zone when exporting to dvw with zones).</p>
<p>If you have set your type-scouting preference to cones and you start
the app with a partially-scouted file that uses zones, the app will
start in zone mode to be consistent with the already-entered data.</p>

<h2 id="device-considerations">Device considerations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#device-considerations"></a>
</h2>
<p>The click-scouting process involves clicking the location of actions
on court, and so a touch screen device (ideally with stylus) is
recommended. It is possible to run the app on a laptop or desktop and
connect to it with a tablet or similar touch device to do the actual
scouting. In this case you would start the app from R on the main device
using the <code>host</code> and <code>launch_browser</code> options:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/ov_scouter.html">ov_scouter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">...</span>, host <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"192.168.1.11"</span>, launch_browser <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>192.168.1.11</code> is the IP address of the main device.
You should see a message similar to (the port number on the end will
vary):</p>
<pre><code>Listening on http://192.168.1.11:5017</code></pre>

</h3>
<p>The .ovs file format is used internally by the app to store a match
as it is being scouted. It is similar to a .dvw file, but contains more
information than a .dvw file and in a different format. If you save a
partially-scouted match and come back to it later to continue scouting,
use the .ovs file format. (You can continue scouting from a
partially-scouted file in .dvw format, but the “undo” functionality is
limited).</p>
<p>If you have finished scouting a match and wish to use that match file
in other analysis software (including the openvolley R packages), export
it to dvw format and use that.</p>

</h3>
<p>ovscout2 relies on the browser to do the actual video playback, but
some videos are not compatible with web browsers. <code>*.MOV</code>
files recorded with iPhones/iPads are known to suffer from this problem.
Try playing the video file directly in the web browser (open a new tab
and drag the video file onto it). If the video doesn’t play in the new
browser tab, you will need to re-encode the video into a
browser-compatible format (try <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" class="external-link uri">https://handbrake.fr/</a>, for example).</p>

<p>No. When the app exits, even if it crashes, it saves your current
